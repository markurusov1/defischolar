DeFi Scholar — Documentation Website (Hugo)

# Overview

The DeFi Scholar repository contains a static documentation/blog site built with Hugo using the Book theme (`github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book`). The site content lives under `content/`, configuration is in `hugo.toml`, and generated output is in `public/`, while Hugo Pipes artifacts live in `resources/`. Both `public/` and `resources/` are re-generated on each build and are kept in Git in this repository.

Live site
- Production URL: https://markurusov1.github.io/defischolar_site/

## Prerequisites
- Hugo (extended) v0.111+ recommended. Download: https://gohugo.io/installation/
- Go 1.20+ (required for Hugo Modules, used to fetch the theme)
- Git
- [Detailed installation instructions](/setup/installation.md)

## Getting started

1) Clone the repository
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/markurusov1/defischolar_site.git
   cd defischolar_site
   ```

2) Fetch Hugo modules (theme and assets)
   ```powershell
   hugo mod get -u
   ```

3) Run the development server
   ```powershell
   # include drafts (-D) if you want to preview draft content
   hugo server -D
   ```
   - Local site: http://localhost:1313/

4) Build for production
   ```powershell
   hugo
   ```
   - The static output goes to `public/`.
   - Hugo also updates `resources/` for processed assets (Hugo Pipes).

## Project structure (high level)
- `hugo.toml` — Site configuration (base URL, theme module, params)
- `content/` — Markdown content for docs, posts, and examples
  - `content/docs/` — Documentation pages (shortcodes, sections, examples)
  - `content/posts/` — Blog posts
- `layouts/` — Layout overrides/partials for the theme
- `assets/` — Custom assets (e.g., JS/CSS) processed by Hugo Pipes
- `public/` — Generated site output (committed here for GitHub Pages)
- `resources/` — Hugo Pipes/cache and processed assets (auto-generated each build; committed in this repo)
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` — Hugo Modules configuration for the theme

## Configuration
This site uses the Book theme via Hugo Modules. Key settings (see `hugo.toml`):
```toml
baseURL = 'https://markurusov1.github.io/defischolar_site/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'DeFi Scholar'

[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = 'github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book'

[params]
# Options: "light" | "dark" | "auto" (default)
BookTheme = "auto"

[markup.goldmark.renderer]
unsafe = true
```
## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
- The base URL is set to the GitHub Pages URL in `hugo.toml`.
- Build locally with `hugo` to update `public/`.
- Commit and push changes on `main` (or your deployment branch) so GitHub Pages serves the updated `public/`.
  - Note: This repository keeps both `public/` and `resources/` tracked in Git. After building, commit changes in both directories as they are regenerated by Hugo.
