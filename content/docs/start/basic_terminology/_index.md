## Networks

>- A lot of material is going to be about networks
>- In the blockchain/de-fi world a network is either a bunch of computers - proper servers, but also phones and
   tables and such or a bunch of people who use these computers to trade, mine, bet and such
>- These people or computers are referred to as “nodes”

## Blockchain 
> - Blockchain is the name of technology - computer programs executing bunch of well-known algorithm 
> - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana are different networks that use Blockchain 
> - Each of these networks uses a specific token - Bitcoin is a token, the NFTs, mem coins, stablecoins - all these 
    > things are tokens 
> - Some of the algorithms have to with cryptography, which is why the people refer to blockchain tokens as 
    > “crypto-currency” or just “crypto”


## P2P (peer to peer) and “De” in DeFi

> - Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network; all peers are equals - they have the same rights on the network 
> - No central authority = DEcentralized network 
> - This is where the “De” in De-Fi coming from

## The "FI" in DeFi

> - The networks we just mentioned allow people to create apps that use tokens to do “proper” finance activities - running exchanges, trading, lending, earning fees and such - hence “Fi” in De-Fi
> - So you now have a decentralized network of equal peers 
> - Anyone can create an app and anyone can use apps 
> - Which is really why the opportunities of De-Fi are limitless
